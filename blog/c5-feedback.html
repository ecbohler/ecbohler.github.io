   <p>
      This week was more challenging as expected and I found myself feeling as if I had not put enough time into truly understand this week's and last week's concepts which was extremely frustrating.

      <h5>Pairing</h5>
      Pairing this week was once again very informative.  I learned from each and every one of my pairs.  I find that when you're driving, you have a chance to actually digest the information and material that the navigator is sharing and this is the most fun part of it all.

      <h5>Feedback</h5>
      Overall I feel good about the feedback receieved.  I believe that it was mostly accurate.  Based on the feedback, I'm going to continue to be pleasant to work with and to have the "we can figure anything out" attiude when working the challenges.  I'm also going to ensure I have a stronger understanding of the concepts to ensure that my pairs benefit technically from me as well as cultually.  Writing feedback was actually great.  I learned a little bit about myself as it allowed me to see that I'm not good at some of the feedback items that I listed for others.
