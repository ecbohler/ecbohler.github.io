    It was my first year as a field engineer and I was working on a project on Long Island in New York with one of my general contractors.  Throughout the course of the project, the GC would inadverently trip an outdoor sprinkler system causing a small grass area to flood.  This did not sit well with the towns chief engineer.  As he and I started to discuss the issue, he lost his cool and so did I.
  </p>
  <p>
    The source of the conflict stemmed from a feeling of being disrespected and disregarded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon analyzing the conflict, I felt annoyed, upset, disrespected and disregarded.
  </p>
  <p>
    We both lost our cool for about 10 minutes or so and then I asked that we take a step back, cool off and try to resolve the issue.  I empathized with him and assured him that my team would put measures in place to avoid tripping the sprinkler system.
  </p>
  <p>
    If I could go back, I probably would not have lost my cool.
  </p>
  <p>
    I learned that being accountable for a team can put you in a situation where you have to take responsibility for someone else's actions.  I also learned to remain professional at all times.
