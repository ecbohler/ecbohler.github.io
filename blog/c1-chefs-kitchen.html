      What’s your take on the DBC experience?  The DBC experience appears to be one of an intense curriculum where you will thrive by exposing your ignorance, having a thirst for knowledge and being able to work well with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is your impression of DBC?  DBC appears to be a nurturing and rigorous environment where you will gain as much as knowledge and understanding as long as you’re willing to be open and work hard.

      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?  This culture will be a challenge to adapt to initially more so in being comfortable with my own ignorance.  Once I’m able to get comfortable with that aspect, the rest should be an easy acclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have your expectations of DBC changed?  If so, how?  My expectations have not changed.  However, I’m more aware of the overall mentality that I need to possess which is that we’re all in this together.

      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?  Does it make you nervous?  I’m very excited about learning in this environment and I want to be able to get over my own internal hurdles as quickly as possible so that I can not only gain the knowledge but also be able to assist and help others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.   Being able to have a “kitchen” mindset aka a creator mindset is important and vital to having a successful career at Dev Bootcamp.  Taking ownership of your experience and helping others is key to developing an understanding of the many concepts that I’ll be learning.
