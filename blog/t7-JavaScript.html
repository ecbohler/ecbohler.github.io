  <h3>Functions and Methods</h3>
   <p>
      JavaScript makes a clear distinction between a function and a method while Ruby does not.
  </p>
  <h3>Accessing Functions</h3>
  <p>
      Access to functions is determined by the scope in which they are defined.  If a function is defined in the global scope, then it's available throughout the entire program.  If a function is defined within an object, it's available only within the context of the object.  For example, toUpperCase() is defined by the String object and can only be invoked on String objects.  All of this holds true for both JavaScript and Ruby.
  </p>
  <h3>Invoking a Function</h3>
  <p>
      Ruby methods are called by their name and parameters with or without ()'s.  JavaScript functions are called in the same way however, a () is required whether parameters are passed or not.  Ruby has an implicit return and JavaScript requires a return clause within the code.  Both Ruby and JavaScript have built-in methods and these methods can be chained together to reduce the amount of written code.
