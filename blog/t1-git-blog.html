      What are the benefits of version control?  Version control allows one or more users to modify files while recording these changes.  These recorded changes aka versions can be called upon at any time if needed.

        Git tracks changes through the use of local (on your computer) repositories that provides version control for your files.  Through your command line and text editor you can see what changes were made to a file.
    </p>
    <p>
        GitHub is a virtual repository (online) where files are stored.  GitHub allows multiple users to access files, make changes through version control and then merge the files as needed.  GitHub provides a platform for collaboration without jeopardizing the quality of the files through overwriting, loss of information or other forms of conflict.
