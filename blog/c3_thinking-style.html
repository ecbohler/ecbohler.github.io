      So...various studies show that I am what they call a Concrete Sequential Thinker.  So far, throughout Phase 0, I've been able to build on my organizational strengths by breaking down exercises and challenges into specific steps in order to cement concepts I've learned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest struggle I've had so far throughout Phase 0 has been working in groups.  It's not that I don't like working in groups or that I'm not doing my part or helping other group members.  I think it's just a personal preference and is directly related to my personal thinking style.  However, when I work in a group, I learn much more and in a shorter amount of time.  Going forward I will continue to pair on exercises and challenges above and beyond the requirement in order to get more comfortable with peer collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to expand my way of thinking, I will surround myself with indivduals who understand the material better than I do.  I will also ask for help sooner than later in order to reduce the time I spend on problems I have difficulty solving.
