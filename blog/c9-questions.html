    <p>
      Going down rabbit holes is a part of the learning process especially when learning how to code.  However, when we find ourselves face to face with a problem that we can't circumvent, we need to be able to ask for help, but ask for help in a clear and concise way.

    <p>
      There is an art to asking good questions and below are a few key points to help drive this concept home:</div>

      <ol>
        <li>Make sure you have a good question title.</li>
        <li>Provide some basics i.e. language version, platform version, O.S., etc.</li>
        <li>Describe what you've tried and the results.  Include results from any research performed as well.</li>
        <li>Provide sample code and sample data where possible</li>
        <li>Provide screen shots where possible</li>
        <li>Proofread for spelling, grammar and formatting.</li>
      </ol>
