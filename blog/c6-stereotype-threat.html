      I'm young, a woman and African American working in a prodominately male industry.  Can I measure up to my colleagues, will I excel, be average or below average?  Will I be given a fair chance, will they treat me like the rest or will they treat me like a "girl"?

      This is how I felt the first day 8 years ago when I started my career as a field engineer in the telecommunications industry.  Although these feelings haunted me for some time initially, it did not last forever.  I realized that it takes time to become confident with what you do day to day.

      I reflected daily on what I had learned from my parents and the experiences from my matriculation at both Spelman College and Georgia Tech in order to deal with the stereotype threats.  My parents were always very supportive and encouraging.  Spelman College provided me with an environment where I was able to interact and learn from other smart and highly motivated African American women everyday.  We were not of the stereotypes by far and it was awesome to be apart of this community.  Georgia Tech was a completely different experience and it was the first time where I experienced stereotype threats.  I didn't do well my first semester because of it but it did not keep me down.  I reflected on my past experiences and things that I had learned which proved that I had the capabilities to succeed and I did.
